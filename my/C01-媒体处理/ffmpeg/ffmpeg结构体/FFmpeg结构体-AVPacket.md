```C
/**
 * This structure stores compressed data. It is typically exported by demuxers
 * and then passed as input to decoders, or received as output from encoders and
 * then passed to muxers.
 *
 * For video, it should typically contain one compressed frame. For audio it may
 * contain several compressed frames. Encoders are allowed to output empty
 * packets, with no compressed data, containing only side data
 * (e.g. to update some stream parameters at the end of encoding).
 *
 * AVPacket is one of the few structs in FFmpeg, whose size is a part of public
 * ABI. Thus it may be allocated on stack and no new fields can be added to it
 * without libavcodec and libavformat major bump.
 *
 * The semantics of data ownership depends on the buf field.
 * If it is set, the packet data is dynamically allocated and is
 * valid indefinitely until a call to av_packet_unref() reduces the
 * reference count to 0.
 *
 * If the buf field is not set av_packet_ref() would make a copy instead
 * of increasing the reference count.
 *
 * The side data is always allocated with av_malloc(), copied by
 * av_packet_ref() and freed by av_packet_unref().
 *
 * @see av_packet_ref
 * @see av_packet_unref

1. dts：解码时间戳，文件里可能没有保存，代码是都需要判断AV_NOPTS_VALUE
2. duration：该packet的长度，以AVStream->time_base为单位，AVStream->time_base，可以理解为一般duration/AVStream->time_base就是该packet以秒为单位的时长
   1. 例如，mp4视频的AVStream->time_base是{1/90000}，AVPacke->duration是3600,
